# Snoop_scraper 
This Python script is an asynchronous web scraper that utilizes OSINT techniques to extract emails and text content from specified URLs, performs sentiment analysis on the text, scrapes images, checks for IP blacklisting, and generates structured reports in JSON and CSV formats, all while ensuring privacy through the use of the Tor network.

## Snoop_scraper = OSINT Web Scraper or Advanced Python Web Scraping Tool

Overview
This OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) Web Scraper is a Python-based tool designed to extract publicly available data from websites for cybersecurity research and intelligence gathering. It features advanced data collection, security measures, anonymity enhancements, and structured data storage to ensure efficient and ethical scraping.

Features
🚀 Data Collection Enhancements
Multithreading & Async Requests – Optimizes speed using concurrent requests.

Automatic Pagination Handling – Detects and follows pagination links.

Keyword-Based Filtering – Extracts only relevant data.

Email & Contact Info Extraction – Identifies publicly available email addresses.

Metadata Collection – Retrieves timestamps, authorship, and other metadata.

Image Scraping & Reverse Lookup – Downloads images and enables further analysis.

Social Media Profile Scraper – Extracts public details from platforms (following ethical guidelines).

API Integration – Uses APIs for structured data retrieval.

🛡️ Security & Privacy Enhancements
Tor Network Support – Routes requests through Tor for anonymity.

Advanced Proxy Rotation – Randomizes IP addresses to avoid detection.

Captcha Bypassing – Uses OCR techniques for automated captcha solving.

Rate Limit Adaptive Requests – Detects and adjusts request speed dynamically.

Dynamic Web Scraping (JavaScript Rendering) – Uses Selenium for scraping JavaScript-heavy sites.

User-Agent Randomization – Changes headers to prevent IP blocking.

Automatic IP Blacklist Detection – Checks if the scraper’s IP is flagged by security databases.

📊 Data Processing & Storage Enhancements
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Text Analysis – Extracts topics and sentiment analysis.

SQLite Database Storage – Securely saves extracted data.

JSON/CSV Export Options – Supports structured data storage.

Machine Learning-Based Threat Analysis – Detects anomalies in gathered intelligence.

Automated Report Generation – Formats OSINT data for structured analysis.

Prerequisites
Before running the scraper, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

pip package manager

Required dependencies (install using requirements.txt):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Tor network enabled (for anonymity)

Tesseract OCR (for captcha recognition)

Google Chrome & Selenium WebDriver (for JavaScript scraping)

API keys (if using API integrations)

Setup Instructions
1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required Python packages:

bash
pip install requests aiohttp bs4 sqlite3 nltk selenium fake_useragent stem pytesseract
2. Configure Proxy & Tor
If using Tor, make sure it’s installed and running:

Start Tor service: tor

Update TOR_PROXY variable in the script:

python
TOR_PROXY = "socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"
3. Run the Script
Execute the script using:

bash
python scraper.py
4. Customize Target URLs
Modify the list of URLs to scrape inside the script:

python
urls = ["https://example.com", "https://target-site.com"]
Ensure you comply with each site's robots.txt rules.

Usage
Basic Mode
Run the script normally for OSINT collection:

bash
python scraper.py
It will:

Fetch and parse website data

Extract emails, metadata, and images

Save results securely (SQLite, JSON, or CSV)

Generate a structured OSINT report

Advanced Features
Enable Tor for anonymity

Modify search filters to extract specific text patterns

Export data in different formats (CSV/JSON)

Integrate third-party APIs for extended intelligence

Perform sentiment analysis and NLP processing

Security Considerations
🔹 Check robots.txt – Ensure compliance with scraping guidelines. 🔹 Use proxies ethically – Avoid excessive requests to prevent detection. 🔹 Respect privacy laws – Do not collect sensitive information unlawfully. 🔹 Ensure anonymity – Use Tor or rotating proxies when needed. 🔹 Implement AI-based detection models – Analyze anomalies for threat intelligence.
